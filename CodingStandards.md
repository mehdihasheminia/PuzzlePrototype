# Coding Style and Standards

## Comments
- **Class-Level Comments**: Every class must include a brief comment explaining its purpose and responsibilities.  
- **Method-Level Comments**: Each method must include a short comment describing what it does, including input/output if relevant.  
- **Complex Logic Comments**: Lines of code containing complex or non-obvious logic must have a concise comment to aid future maintainers.  
- **Avoid Over-Commenting**: Do not comment every line of code. Comments should clarify intent, not repeat what is already clear from the code itself.
